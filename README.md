**OpenFrequency** is a next-generation, open-source Air Traffic Control system for flight simulators.

Born from the vision of creating a free, accessible, and highly intelligent alternative to paid services like SayIntentions.AI, OpenFrequency aims to democratize realistic simulation. By leveraging powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini, it brings "human" controllers and cabin crew to your cockpit without the subscription fee.

## Why OpenFrequency? 🚀

Simulation enthusiasts deserve an immersion system that:
1.  **Understands Context**: Remembers your request from 5 minutes ago and knows your flight plan.
2.  **Speaks Naturally**: No more robotic "One-Two-Three". Hear natural accents, static, and hesitation.
3.  **Features Depth**: From emergency checklists to cabin announcements, it covers the full flight experience.
4.  **Costs Nothing**: Built on free/affordable APIs. No $30/mo subscriptions.

## Features ✨

*   **🧠 Intelligent Core**: Powered by LLMs (Gemini, Gemma, or OpenAI), handling complex negotiations naturally.
*   **wu Career Mode (Alpha)**:
    *   **XP System**: Earn points for smooth landings and safe operations.
    *   **Violation Tracking**: Penalties for speeding, hard landings, or unstable approaches.
    *   **Free Flight**: Toggle off for casual flying.
*   **👥 Real Crew Experience**:
    *   **Role Separation**: First Officer assists in cockpit; Purser manages the cabin.
    *   **Ambience**: Play boarding music/announcements directly from the UI.
    *   **Intercom**: Chat naturally with your crew via text or voice.
*   **🚨 Emergency Scenarios 2.0**:
    *   Bird strikes, engine fires, hydraulic failures.
    *   Configurable probability levels (None/Low/Medium/High).
    *   Specific system failure alerts.
*   **🌍 Multi-Simulator Support**:
    *   **MSFS** / **Prepar3D** / **FSX** via SimConnect
    *   **X-Plane 12** via the official Local Web API
*   **🎯 Visual Head Tracking**: Zero-cost webcam-based head tracking.
*   **🗣️ Voice of the Sky**: High-quality Edge-TTS voices with real-time radio effects.
*   **📱 Glass Cockpit UI**: Responsive web dashboard with dark mode and internationalization (EN/CN/JP).
